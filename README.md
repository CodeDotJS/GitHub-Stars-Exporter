<p align="center"><b>GitHub Starred Repositories Exporter</b></p>


# Overview

A web application that allows users to export their (or anyone else's) starred repositories from GitHub in JSON or CSV format. I initially built this tool to create a backup of my starred repositories so that I could unstar repositories without worrying about losing something important.

A live demo of the application is available __[here](https://starexports.vercel.app)__. To get started with, simply enter your GitHub username (or any other user's) and hit enter. Once the data is fetched, you can download it as a JSON or CSV file.
